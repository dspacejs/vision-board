# vision-board

Create a simple. private, and offline vision board. WIP. 

## Features

* Add photos/videos locally to an `assets` directory
* Simple JSON database for the board's layout
* Adjust the size and description of each image
* Customise the layout of your board (add sections, titles, design the photo grid, etc)
* Built with Gatsby, so it's fast and optimised by default
* Run the dev server locally to access your vision board (and host it if you want to, such as on a private local network)
